# flutter_form_builder_example

Provides examples of how to declare and use many common form fields from the [Flutter Form Builder](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_form_builder/) package.

This is a stand-alone Flutter app that was built from the example directory of the Flutter Form Builder Package. 

It illustrates the use of the following widgets:
* [FormBuilder]
* [FormBuilderDateTimePicker]
* [FormBuilderDateRangePicker]
* [FormBuilderSlider]
* [FormBuilderValidators]
* [FormBuilderRangeSlider]
* [FormBuilderCheckbox]
* [FormBuilderTextField]
* [FormBuilderDropdown]
* [FormBuilderRadioGroup]
* [FormBuilderSegmentedControl]
* [FormBuilderSwitch]
* [FormBuilderCheckboxGroup]
* [FormBuilderFieldOption]
* [FormBuilderFilterChip]
* [FormBuilderChoiceChip]

The UI below is generated from just a single file: main.dart.  This repo also contains some other files to illustrate additional use cases.
